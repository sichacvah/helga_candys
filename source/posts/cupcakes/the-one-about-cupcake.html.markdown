============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one
SPLIT_SUMMARY_BEFORE_THIS
Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.
THIS IS SPARTA
> Block quotes are

> They can span multiple paragraphs,

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺
